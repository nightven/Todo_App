## About project 

The Todo planers project is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate mastery of modern web development tools and frameworks. It is built using TypeScript on both the front-end and back-end, which ensures the safety and reliability of types throughout the application.

Backend
The backend is powered by Express with Prisma ORM for database management, which connects to a PostgreSQL database. Authentication is managed by Passport, which provides secure user login and session handling. The entire backend is written in TypeScript, which provides reliable type checking and error prevention during development.

Frontend
The frontend is built using React with Zustand for state management. React Hook Form is used for form processing, providing seamless data entry and validation processes. The user interface is stylized with Blueprint and Emotion CSS, creating a visually appealing and responsive design. TypeScript is also used on the frontend to maintain consistency and prevent potential errors.
